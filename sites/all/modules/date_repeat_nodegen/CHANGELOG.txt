Date Repeat Node Generator 6.x

6.x-2.x-dev
===========

Bugfixes:
- #1331490 by vgriffin: Save a copy of $node before the first 
call to node_submit. Use that to initialize new nodes so path and 
other fields will initialize to unset values. Use standard node-
handling calls. Clean up url_alias in version update. Supercedes 
patch.
- #601456  by vgriffin: Call node_submit and node_save for first 
and subsequent node. Replaces patch.
- #438108  by vgriffin: Initialize each node to values before 
node_submit or node_save. This unsets values used by any standard 
field-creating module.
- Remove sequence members from internal table upon node deletion. 
Remove sequence definitions when all members are deleted.
