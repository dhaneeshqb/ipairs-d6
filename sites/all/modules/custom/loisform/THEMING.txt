Overview
--------
Loisform supports theming similar to the CCK or Views modules. Any loisform
may be themed on the server side, though doing so may require a reasonable
amount of knowledge about the Drupal Form API. More information about the Form
API may be found at http://api.drupal.org/api/file/developer/topics/forms_api.html

Theme submission e-mails
-----------------------
The default e-mails sent by loisform are fairly basic. If you like, you may
customize the display of e-mails sent by each individual loisform.

- Open the Loisform module directory.

- Copy (do not move!) the "loisform-mail.tpl.php" file to your theme directory.

- Open up the new file and edit it to your liking. The loisform-mail.tpl.php file
  contains further instructions on how to get started with theming the e-mail.

- If you want to edit the e-mail sent by only one particular loisform, rename the
  file "loisform-mail-[node id here].tpl.php", replacing [node id here] with the
  node ID of the loisform.

- Clear the theme cache! Visit admin/settings/performance and click the
  "Clear cached data" button at the bottom of the page. You may also find
  using devel module will speed up this process a bit. This needs to be done
  every time you create or rename a .tpl.php file, but isn't necessary once
  these files already exist.

- To get a better idea of what variables are available to you, you can include
  the print_r function in your email. Simply include the line:

  <?php print_r($submission) ?>

  to get a listing of all the available fields you can use in your mail.

- Advanced Loisform e-mail Theming: Theming the e-mail headers may also be done
  by overriding the theme_loisform_mail_headers() function from loisform.module.
  Just copy the code out of loisform.module and change as necessary in your
  template.php file. This allows you to customize the e-mail headers.

Theme the confirmation page
---------------------------

After a user submits a loisform, they are directed to a page that contains the
confirmation message set in the loisform node settings (assuming the form doesn't
direct to a complete URL). These instructions let you customize the format of
the confirmation page of a single node or all loisforms on your site.

- Open the Loisform module directory.

- Copy (do not move!) the "loisform-confirmation.tpl.php" file to your theme
  directory.

- Open the new file and change it's contents to the your liking. Here's an
  example that inserts some additional HTML around the confirmation message and
  gives links to edit the submission.

  <?php /* Begin sample loisform confirmation page */ ?>

  <div class="confirmation-message">
    <?php print $confirmation_message ?>
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="<?php print url('node/'. $node->nid . '/submission/'. $sid)?>">View your submission</a></li>
    <li><a href="<?php print url('node/'. $node->nid . '/submission/'. $sid .'/edit')?>">Edit your submission</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <?php /* End sample loisform confirmation page */ ?>

- You may edit the loisform-confirmation.tpl.php file in your theme directory,
  this will affect all the loisform mails sent by your entire site. Or, if you
  want to edit the e-mail sent by only one particular loisform, rename the file
  "loisform-confirmation-[node id here].tpl.php", replacing [node id here] with
  the node ID of the loisform.

- Visit admin/settings/performance and click the "Clear cached data" button.

Theme display of an entire loisform
----------------------------------

Theming a loisform can be useful for rearranging elements or customizing the
appearance of multiple components at once. This tutorial assumes usage
of the phptemplate engine.

- Copy the "loisform-form.tpl.php" file from the loisform directory to your
  theme directory. You may rename this file
  "loisform-form-[node id here].tpl.php" if you want to theme one particular
  loisform on your site. Replace [node id here] with the node ID of the loisform.

- Open up your new file and customize the loisform however you like.

- Visit admin/settings/performance and click the "Clear cached data" button.

- All Loisform forms have 2 main fieldsets: "submitted", and "details". Although
  you may move things around as you wish, keep all your components within the
  "submitted" fieldset. Only the "submitted" fieldset is displayed and Loisform
  depends on the other two to operate properly, so don't mess with them unless
  you have good reason to do so (like you're forwarding your loisform to a custom
  PHP or PERL script).

Theme display of a loisform submission display
---------------------------------------------

Theming the display of a loisform submission works the same way as theming a
loisform form. Loisform uses Drupal "renderable" style arrays for the display of
submissions, just like most forms in Drupal.

The template file for theming submissions is loisform-submission.tpl.php. You can
use loisform-submission-[node id here].tpl.php for individual nodes if desired.
Note that the contents of this template are used not only for display of
submissions in the Loisform interface but also in e-mails when printing out
the %email_values token.
